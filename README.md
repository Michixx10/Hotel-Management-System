## OBJECTIVES
Here's the logic behind our project. The design of our project is based on SAS applications where 
we provide Software as Service. Firstly, we are the super admins of this application and the hotel 
owners can get our application on subscription based model. We will be registering the hotels in 
database and authenticating them to use this application.
The purpose is to build this in a way that this reduces the manual and paper work for managing 
hotels, guest’s and employee’s data. Moreover, we have also added to functionality to provide 
hotel reports in order to maintain the record of bookings and payments.
We have provided full rights to user where he can add, update, search and delete information when 
required. Best database design is used in order to increase efficiency of managing data from various 
hotels.

• Adding, updating, deleting and searching Hotels.
• Generate hotel reports based of bookings.
• Adding services.
• Adding employees. (CRUD)
• Adding guests (CRUD)
• Maintaining payments of guests.
